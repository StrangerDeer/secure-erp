## Description
This project was a study exercise, where we learned file handling, text parsing and OOP principles in CPP. 
The theme chosen was a text-based minigame playable in the console/terminal where you could enter warriors into the system, have them battle and treat their injuries. 

## Start
Use an IDE or compile the project to start it. Enter the numbers displayed in the menu to add a warrior to the crm.csv file. 
Battle the warriors, the results logged in batle.csv. If they get injured send them to the medical center, which stores each visit in the medcenter.csv file.
